# Dengue-prediction

Question statement - Using environmental data collected by various U.S. Federal Government agencies—from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the U.S. Department of Commerce—can you predict the number of dengue fever cases reported each week in San Juan, Puerto Rico and Iquitos, Peru?

Before looking into the data set, I did some initial analysis about temperature dependence on mosquito breeding rate, and on dengue virus - to find out that both of the cities posses the conditions for mosquitoes to thrive.

## Looking at EDA we find interesting insights:

![Iquitos EDA](https://github.com/adityaadi13/Dengue-prediction/blob/master/Images/4.PNG)
Important factors for San Juan that affect the number of dengue cases are different from Iquitos - meaning that it is critical that we make different models for them!
